# Inside-CoreXY
## An Inside-H inspired CoreXY style 3D printer kinematics system

#### Settings
The system requires the same input as the standard CoreXY system.

#### Might be useful for:
- Positron style 3D printers
- Cantilever-style 3D printers that want a CoreXZ

## Notes:
Apr 1, 2025: I am so glad to see that I'm not the first one that came up with this idea. Here's a project from 3 years ago that utilizes CoreXZ on a cantilever 3D printer. It's kinda simpler then my approach here: https://github.com/jomettler/KP3s-coreXZ
